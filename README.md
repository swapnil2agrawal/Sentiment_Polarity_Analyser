## Sentiment polarity analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Objective

To implement a working Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, i.e., a sentiment polarity analyzer, using binary logistic regression to determine whether a review is positive or negative using movie reviews as data. 

## Setup

<b>Requirements</b>
    - Python 3.7
    - numpy library preinstalled
    
<b>Instructions</b>
- Download feature.py and open it with any python text editor
- Run the feature.py on the movie review dataset to convert raw data into feature vectors
- Download the lr.py and open it with a python text editor
- Use the featured vectors from feature.py and train a logistic regression model on the dataset
- Use the trained model to predict sentiment of a new movie review
